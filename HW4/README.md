# PHYS 461 - Homework 4

## Contributors:

**Jarrod Bieber** - Munged the data, supplied the initial code for the getradii and vratios functions, and produced the initial histograms and plots.

**Katie Moses** - Reviewed the answers to the questions given in the assignment, and reviewed the code for the getradii and vratios functions, and the histograms and plots.

**Timothy Tomaszewski** - Reviewed the answers to the questions given in the assignment, and reviewed the code for the getradii and vratios functions, and the histograms and plots.

For Homework 3 Part II: Katie spent a good deal of time conseptualizing the problem, and the initial code of the problem. TJ helped get ideas down on the chalkboard for reference, and built out the problem that way, figuring out what we didn't know. I helped with this part as well. After Katie had determined code flow and was able to get individual data points (outside of a for loop), TJ got the code working in a for loop with the help of ChatGPT and got everything formatted correctly with assistance from myself. Katie was able to read and understand the code, and was able to compare our graphs to those in Correll's 2018 and explain the significance of the results. Finally, TJ also worked on some of the coordination aspects of both notebooks.
