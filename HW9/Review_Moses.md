Review:

The new graph adds better color contrast between the colors, which enhances overall accessiblity and readability of the data. The graph also includes grid lines, a title, updated axes labels, and includes a caption. These help convey the data more effectively, which again helps to reduce ambiguity of the plot. There was nothing overtly distracting from the old graph, and the new graph does not add anything that could lead to a distraction from the data. There is also no distortion of any data happening, as everything is clearly laid out in a simple format. Overall, the updated graph is better as it has higher readability and accessibility without creating any hinderances in conveying the data.

Bad Plot from Literature:

The bad plot included here is atrocious. It is impossible to read any of the data, as the graph is just a chunk of blue lines with all of the curves being indistinguishable here. It is impossible to make any sense of what is happening. It is near impossible to read the axes because of how loud the center chunk of blue is. Overall, it is not readable, not accessible, not useful.
