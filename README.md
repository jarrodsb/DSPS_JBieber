I took this class to better prepare myself for Graduate School work in the field of astronomy / astrophysics.

I hope to learn about handling and extracting information from large datasets.

My past experience with Python and Jupyter notebooks, as well as experience working with TESS data from the MAST database are likely to help me in this class.
