# PHYS 461 - Homework 11
---

## Contributors:

**Jarrod Bieber** - Completed all parts of the assignments, including configuring and training the MLP and CNN autoencoder models, producing the plots, and writing the captions / analysis. I largely worked solo on this assignment, although I did have some discussions and compared results with both Katie Moses and TJ Tomaszewski.

Note - I did run into the "Invalid Notebook" rendering issue in GitHub for this assignment. I got around this issue with the solution suggested - I saved the .ipynb file as a JSON, downloaded it and and opened it in a text editor, deleted the "widgets{...}" component, resaved the file as a .ipynb, and uploaded it directly to my HW11 folder in GitHub. As a consequence, my notebook cannot be opened directly in Colab.
